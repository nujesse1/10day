# Testing Smart Proof Verification System

## Overview
The proof verification system uses GPT-4 Vision to:
1. **Analyze images** to identify what habit they prove
2. **Match automatically** to your existing habits
3. **Verify legitimacy** of the proof
4. **Complete habits** without you having to specify which one!

## What Was Built

### 1. Image Analysis Service (`proof_verifier.py`)
- **NEW:** `analyze_image_for_habit()` - Uses GPT-4 Vision to identify what habit an image represents
- Downloads images from Twilio URLs (WhatsApp)
- Loads images from local file paths (CLI)
- Returns structured analysis: `{habit_identified, activity_type, key_details, confidence}`
- Original `verify_proof()` still validates legitimacy

### 2. Smart Completion Tool (`chat_engine.py`)
- **NEW:** `complete_habit_from_image` tool - Fully automatic completion:
  1. Analyze image → identify habit
  2. Match to existing habits using LLM
  3. Verify proof legitimacy
  4. Mark complete
- Original `complete_habit` tool still works for explicit habit names
- Auto-detects Twilio URLs vs local file paths
- Comprehensive logging at each step

### 3. WhatsApp Integration (`whatsapp.py`)
- Extracts media URLs from Twilio webhook
- Passes them to chat engine for smart completion
- Works with image-only messages

### 4. CLI Integration (`cli.py`)
- Parses file paths from user input
- Supports: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .heic, .webp, .bmp
- Auto-expands ~ to home directory
- Can send just the image path for smart completion

### 5. Enhanced Prompt (`prompts.py`)
- Updated Drill Sergeant to use smart completion
- Guides LLM to use `complete_habit_from_image` when image provided
- Still demands proof aggressively

## How to Test

### Test 1: Smart Image Completion (Just Send Image!)

**The new way - AI figures out which habit:**

1. Start the CLI:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python3 cli.py
   ```
2. Add some habits:
   ```
   > add morning workout
   > add meditation
   > add reading
   ```
3. Just send an image:
   ```
   > done ~/Desktop/workout-screenshot.png
   ```
   OR even simpler:
   ```
   > ~/Desktop/workout-screenshot.png
   ```

**Expected behavior:**
- `[IMAGE ANALYSIS]` Analyzes image → identifies "morning workout"
- `[SMART COMPLETION]` Matches to your "morning workout" habit
- `[PROOF VERIFICATION]` Verifies it's legitimate
- ✅ Habit marked complete automatically!

### Test 2: CLI with Explicit Habit Name

1. Complete by specifying the habit:
   ```
   > done morning workout ~/Desktop/screenshot.png
   ```

**Expected behavior:**
- CLI detects the file path
- Logs show: `[PROOF VERIFICATION] Starting verification...`
- GPT-4 Vision analyzes the image
- If legitimate → Habit marked complete
- If fake/irrelevant → Rejected with reasoning

### Test 3: CLI without Proof

1. Try to complete without proof:
   ```
   > done morning workout
   ```

**Expected behavior:**
- Drill Sergeant demands proof
- Habit NOT marked complete
- Error message: "PROOF REQUIRED..."

### Test 4: WhatsApp Smart Completion

**Just send the image - no text needed!**

1. Send ONLY a screenshot to your WhatsApp bot
   - No text required
   - Just the image

**Expected behavior:**
- `[MEDIA]` Received 1 media attachment(s)
- `[IMAGE ANALYSIS]` Identifies what habit it is
- `[SMART COMPLETION]` Matches to your habits
- `[PROOF VERIFICATION]` Verifies legitimacy
- ✅ Automatic completion with details!

Bot response example:
> "Alright, analyzed your screenshot. That's clearly your morning workout. Marked complete. Don't expect praise."

### Test 5: WhatsApp with Text + Image

1. Send: "done" + attach screenshot

**Expected behavior:**
- Smart completion runs
- Same automatic flow as Test 4

### Test 6: WhatsApp without Proof

1. Send text only: "done morning workout"
2. Don't attach any image

**Expected behavior:**
- Bot responds: "PROOF REQUIRED. You must provide a screenshot or photo as evidence. No excuses."
- Habit NOT marked complete

## Verification Criteria

GPT-4 Vision checks for:
- **ACCEPT:** Clear proof directly showing habit completion
- **REJECT:**
  - Screenshots of screenshots (fake)
  - Staged/fake proof
  - Irrelevant images
  - Memes or jokes
  - Unclear evidence

## Logging

### Smart Completion Logs

When using image-first completion, you'll see:

```
[IMAGE ANALYSIS] Loading image from local file: /path/to/image.png
[IMAGE ANALYSIS] Loaded 1234567 bytes
[IMAGE ANALYSIS] Calling GPT-4 Vision for habit identification
[IMAGE ANALYSIS] ✓ Analysis complete
[IMAGE ANALYSIS] Identified habit: morning workout session
[IMAGE ANALYSIS] Activity type: exercise
[IMAGE ANALYSIS] Confidence: high

[SMART COMPLETION] Starting smart image-based completion
[SMART COMPLETION] Step 1: Analyzing image to identify habit...
[SMART COMPLETION] Identified: morning workout session
[SMART COMPLETION] Step 2: Matching to existing habits...
[SMART COMPLETION] Matched to habit: morning workout
[SMART COMPLETION] Step 3: Verifying proof legitimacy...

[PROOF VERIFICATION] Starting verification for habit: morning workout
[PROOF VERIFICATION] ✓ Verification complete
[PROOF VERIFICATION] Verified: True
[PROOF VERIFICATION] Confidence: high
[PROOF VERIFICATION] Reasoning: Legitimate fitness app screenshot with activity data

[SMART COMPLETION] Proof verified: Legitimate fitness app screenshot...
[SMART COMPLETION] Step 4: Marking habit complete...
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Twilio credentials not configured"
- Set `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env`
- Only needed for WhatsApp, not CLI

### "Proof image not found"
- Check file path is correct
- Use absolute path or ~/ for home directory
- Ensure file has image extension (.png, .jpg, etc.)

### "Verification failed"
- Check OpenAI API key is set
- Ensure you have access to GPT-4 Vision (gpt-4o model)
- Check image is not corrupted

### "Could not match to any existing habit"
- Image was analyzed but doesn't match any of your habits
- Add the habit first, or try a clearer screenshot
- Check logs to see what the AI identified

## Cost Considerations

Each smart completion costs approximately:
- Image analysis: ~$0.01-0.03 (GPT-4 Vision)
- Habit matching: ~$0.001 (gpt-4o-mini)
- Proof verification: ~$0.01-0.03 (GPT-4 Vision)
- **Total per smart completion: ~$0.02-0.06**

For explicit completions (you specify habit):
- Proof verification only: ~$0.015-0.035

For WhatsApp, add Twilio message costs (~$0.005 per message).

## Flow Diagrams

### Smart Completion Flow
```
User sends image →
  ↓
[1] Analyze image with GPT-4 Vision
  → Identifies: "morning workout session"
  ↓
[2] Match to existing habits using LLM
  → Matches: "morning workout" (habit ID 59)
  ↓
[3] Verify proof with GPT-4 Vision
  → Checks legitimacy for "morning workout"
  ↓
[4] Mark complete if verified
  → Updates database
  → Returns success message
```

### Explicit Completion Flow
```
User: "done morning workout" + image →
  ↓
[1] Match "morning workout" to habit
  ↓
[2] Verify proof with GPT-4 Vision
  ↓
[3] Mark complete if verified
```

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
1. Store verification results in database (`proof_verified`, `verification_reasoning` columns)
2. Allow users to appeal rejected proofs
3. Add habit-specific proof requirements
4. Support multiple proof images per habit
5. Add proof expiration (e.g., must be from today)
6. Learning from user corrections (if AI misidentifies, learn from feedback)
